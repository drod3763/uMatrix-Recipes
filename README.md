uMatrix Recipes

This is just a personal repository for uMatrix Recipes with the rules that I use. 
This is meant to be an easy way to share rules with my family and new machines since sync is kinda unreliable.
It will prioritize convenience over security by favoring global rules for 3rd parties that happen on multiple 
sites (like CAPTCHA).
